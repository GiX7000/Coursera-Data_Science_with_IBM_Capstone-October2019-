For this reason, we are going to use Foursquare API in order to get nearest venues of each neighborouhood. Regarding neighbourhoods, we will use Google Maps geocoding API to get coordinates of each of them. We, previously, get London's neighbourhood list from wikipedia, by using the appropriate library. By using combined data, we will suggest some good location for opening a healthy food and supplement store."
